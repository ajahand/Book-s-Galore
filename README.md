# BOOK-S-GALORE

Book's Galore, an Indian bookstore, seeks to deepen its comprehension of sales dynamics. 
The store factors in several variables when determining pricing, such as item prices,
shipping expenses, quantity, and cost prices. 
Our investigation will center on these components to evaluate the potential profitability of items, 
thereby facilitating efficient inventory management and stocking strategies.
